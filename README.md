This guide aims to explain how to modify a save file for Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga on PC (This also works on Mac save files) and go into details about how the game stores progression. The game writes to the save file in little-endian format. A guide on binary and hex code will be in this document to make it easier to understand how the values in the save file work. This is not intended to cheat as it’s best to have completed the game to know how these values translate in the game. On PC the save files are stored in the directory C:\Users\<Windows Username>\AppData\Local\LucasArts and on Mac it’s in ~/Library/Application Support/LucasArts/ or ~/Library/Application Support/Feral Interactive/LEGO Star Wars Saga/VFS/User/AppData/Roaming/LucasArts/ on later releases. Inside the folders LEGO Star Wars - The Complete Saga/SavedGames on both PC and Mac, the game can have up to 6 save files. The file names range from “SaveGame0.LEGO Star Wars - The Complete Saga_SavedGame” to “SaveGame5.LEGO Star Wars - The Complete Saga_SavedGame” (as required for how many save files exist).
